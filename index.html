    <h3> Progressive Enhancement</h3>
    <p>
      Progressive Enhancement allows the web developer to make a full interactive website by using a very simple key concept. This concept allows the developer to efficiently work on the website from the ground up. The analogy of Peanut m&m, the concept of working from inside out. The peanuts represent the strong base of all html files, providing a strong base foundation for extra content. The chocolate on top of peanut provides the foundation for the css to be applied and experimented to the developers desire. The wrapper for the m&m represents the endless possibilities of javascript. This will allow the developer to display and represent the website to their own desire with animations. Prgressive Enhancement is a concept of adding to your website one layer at a time.

    <h3> Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    First attempt at working on the dragon project was interesting and sort of difficult to set up for the first time. After everything was set up I was able to put my full attention on getting the strong base foundation for the html code. At this point working with html code was very easy and I was able to finish the base layer of the page fairly easy. After the html code was completed it was time to move on the css side of the web page. At first I didn't know what I wanted my webpage to look like. After searching the internet to find ideas , I slowly started to apply those ideas. Some css code didn’t work well with others. I encountered a lot of error mix and matching ideas with each other. I slowly started to learn how css really worked. Many errors involved the images I was using. Some images didn’t fit well with the theme I was trying to create and they will spill over the border. After numerous hours of working on the page I was finally able to create a functional website. The website was by no mean perfect and was very simple but I truly learned a lot by working on it.

    The feedback from my brother was very important in shaping how the website should look like. I was able to fix a couple errors that were making the faq page and history. When I tried to put css on the table it didn’t but after the revision of the code was easily able add css to the table. Couple minor coding errors I was making were also solved after the revision. I was able to make the website flow a little better.
